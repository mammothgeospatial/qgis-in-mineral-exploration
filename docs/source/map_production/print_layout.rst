Print Layout
============

The Print Layout is the tool to produce maps for output. Various standard page sizes can be selected as well as creating custom sizes. Everything to do with the final map design is done in the print layout. If you lose tab views, click on the “Views” menu option in the layout window and scroll down to Panels to reselect them for display.

To ensure you get true scale plots, it is important to have the main map projection in a metres projection (i.e. UTM) and not in a geographic lat/long projection. Problems may be created with the scale not being correct on the map output when the main map window is in a lat/long projection.
