A Compilation of How-To's
=========================

This is a list of processes that hopefully will help the users of QGIS with specific geological-type tasks.

1. Set drill |collars| RL from a DTM
2. Plot oriented structure symbols
3. Getting and using the USGS symbol and pattern fills
4. Where do I find good instructional videos
5. "No gaps" editing
6. Exporting drill collar points to your GPS
7. Exporting tracks to your GPS

QGIS is a volunteer driven project. They welcome contributions in the form of code contributions, bug fixes, bug reports, contributed documentation, advocacy and supporting other users on their mailing lists and gis.stackexchange.com. If you are interested in actively supporting the project, you can find more information under the development menu and on the QGIS Wiki. If you find QGIS valuable in your workplace, please donate to the QGIS project - the details are on the website.

QGIS provides a continuously growing number of capabilities provided by core functions and plugins.

This document will mainly address workflows for geoscientists but there are many other tools available in QGIS and worthy of some exploration of their functions. Currently QGIS does not have a detailed downhole or cross section display option, but there are groups across the world that are crowd sourcing the development of the drill hole and cross section plug-in. The existing Geoscience plugin does display drill holes in plan and in cross section but is limited in its features. QGIS does not also handle all the various geophysical processing options, and again there is interest from various groups to develop plug-ins for geophysical processing.

A good explanation of QGIS and where it came from can be found `here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As4hfPecxoU>`_.
If you find QGIS makes a valuable contribution to your business, please consider `making a donation <https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/donations.html>`_ to assist with continual code improvements.

Installation options are available on the `QGIS download page <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html>`_ with options to download either the development version (via OSGeo4W) or the standalone installers (recommended).
