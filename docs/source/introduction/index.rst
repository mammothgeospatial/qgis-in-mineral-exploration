This document is aimed at the exploration geologist, but the techniques outlined are easily transferrable to other areas. The author has been using QGIS since 2015 and the version used in this document is version 3.34.

The reader is encouraged to join the international online `QGIS user forum <http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-user>`_.

This document will not go into the detail that is covered by the official `QGIS User Guide and Training Manuals <https://www.qgis.org/resources/hub/>`_ and other reference books (e.g. Graser 2016) on QGIS on topics like editing etc., but will discuss those tools used particularly in geological mapping, mineral exploration and remote sensing. See `this video <https://youtu.be/jZYKGrIyVCA>`_ for an explanation of some of the advanced editing functions.
