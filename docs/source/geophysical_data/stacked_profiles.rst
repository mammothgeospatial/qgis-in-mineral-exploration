Creating Stacked Profiles and Colour Bars
=========================================

Creating “stacked profiles” of data, especially magnetic data is important for the identification of small discrete features in wide spaced aeromagnetic data. One example is in the search for kimberlite pipes in regional (>300 m) spaced line data.

This algorithm has been created by Benoit at `GeoProcessing <http://www.geoproc.com/be/plugins.xml>`_ in South Africa and is part of their “GeoProc” toolset. The stacked profile tool allows the user to import located line data to plot stacked profiles of the data. It is important that the located data is in "point" format not multi-point data format.
