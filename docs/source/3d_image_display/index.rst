3D Image Display

QGIS v3 now has a 3D view capability built in as a standard part of the program (3d Map View) or by using the QGIS2threejs plugin. The QGIS2threejs is the best option at this time for viewing geological data in 3D. Downhole drill hole traces can be displayed if the 3D coordinates have been calculated.
